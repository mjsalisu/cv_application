### Requirements:

- A brief personal bio

#### Home/First Page (CV View)

- This will be the initial screen users encounter upon opening the app.
- It will come pre-filled with your aforementioned details.
- Craft this page in a clean and organized manner to present the CV information clearly.

#### Editing Capability

- Include a dedicated page or screen for editing the CV particulars.
- This editing page should offer user-friendly fields or sections for modifying the existing CV data.

#### Real-time Updates:

- After making changes to the CV details, returning to the home/first page should immediately reflect the alterations.
- Ensure the app updates dynamically without requiring manual refresh.

#### Acceptance Criteria:

- **Legibility**: All content within the application, particularly on the home/first page, must be legible, easy to read, and well-structured.
- **Multi-screen Application**: The application should encompass at least two distinct screens or pages - the primary - CV viewing page and the editing page.
- **No Third-party Dependencies**: Develop the application exclusively using the native capabilities of the mobile platform, without integrating any third-party tools, packages, plugins, or libraries.
- **Documentation**: Incorporate a README.md file in your repository, providing clear setup instructions, an overview of the application, its functionalities, and any other pertinent details.
